EscherPHP - HTTP request signing lib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emartech/escher-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emartech/escher-php)
===================================

Escher helps you creating secure HTTP requests (for APIs) by signing HTTP(s) requests. It's both a server side and client side implementation. The status is work in progress.

The algorithm is based on [Amazon's _AWS Signature Version 4_](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html), but we have generalized and extended it.

More details will be available at our [documentation site](https://documentation.emarsys.com/).
